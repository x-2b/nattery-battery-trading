Okay, I've processed the document to remove the empty page and consolidate all register-like information into a single, comprehensive table in the format you requested.

I've kept the initial version history and protocol descriptions as a preamble because they provide context but aren't registers themselves. The "Description of Units and Scale" is also included before the main table as it's crucial for interpreting the register values.

**Please note:**
*   Markdown tables can be very wide. The display might require horizontal scrolling.
*   I've done my best to interpret and map all data to the new table structure.
*   For some status/command registers, fields like "Magnification," "Unit," etc., might not be directly applicable and are left blank or inferred.
*   The "Table 1: Fault description" (from page 15 of the PDF) is referenced in the remarks of the relevant alarm registers (SysAlarmFlag, AlarmDetail) as it describes the bit meanings within those registers, rather than being a list of registers itself.

Here's the enhanced text content:

**Home Storage Inverter MODBUS Protocol Format Description**

This document defines the protocol to follow the Modbus-RTU communication protocol, support 03, 06, 10 function codes, read and write registers at a time not more than 32.

**1. Serial communication parameters**
9600,n,8,1, i.e. baud rate 9600, 8 data bits, no parity.
RS485 connection mode is one master and multiple slaves, the default address of inverter is 1, which can be set. Support 255 omnipotent address (FFH), in the case of one-to-one connection between host and inverter, communication access to the inverter can be made through 255, and the address responded by the inverter is the actual address. Host broadcast address is 0.

**2. Data format**
Standard Modbus RTU frame format is used.
*   **Function Codes Supported:**
    *   `03H`: Read Multiple Holding Registers
    *   `06H`: Write Single Holding Register
    *   `10H (16 decimal)`: Write Multiple Holding Registers
*   **CRC Check:** 16-bit CRC (CRC-16-MODBUS) is used. Low byte first, then high byte.
*   **Error Codes:** (Refer to page 3 of the PDF for the full table, common Modbus errors like Illegal Function, Illegal Data Address, etc.)

**3. Description of Units and Scale**

**Note on 32-bit data:** The lower 16 bits of the data are at the lower address of the register, and the higher 16 bits of the data are at the higher address of the register. For example, 32-bit data 0x12345678 is stored in two addresses 0x0001 and 0x0002, and the order in the register table is address 0x0001=0x5678, address 0x0002=0x1234.

**Note on Table 1: Fault description (from PDF page 15):**
This table describes the meaning of individual bits within the alarm registers (like `SysAlarmFlag` at 0x75A5 - 0x75AC and the first 4 words of `AlarmDetail` at 0x9A4C). It's a lookup table for interpreting those bit-packed alarm statuses. For example, if Bit0 of Word0 (0x75A5) is 1, it means "Battery Low Voltage Alarm".
